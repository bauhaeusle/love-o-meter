# Love-O-Meter

Small Teensy ++2.0 project to sense how "near" are two people to each other. 
The goal is to have a little machine that shows you "magically" how deep in love two or more people are. 
The Love-O-Meter was built to accelerate the social interaction bejond drinking at parties. 

## Installation

With Teensyduino, just upload the code to your teensy over USB. 
## Layout

Will be there soon.
